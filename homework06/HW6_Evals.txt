
Evaluation for homework 06: Brobdingnagian Integer
   and associated Collatz sequence using BrobInt

BrobInt class
Includes running BrobIntTester test harness
Includes running Collatz requesting several numbers
   View h6.bat or h6.sh to see test parameters used
   View testresults.txt to see resulting output
NOTE: "Brobdingnagian Integer" is abbreviated "BrobInt"
   per the discussion in class
=======================================================

The BrobInt.java file and the Collatz.java file must exists and compile.  There
are a total of 7 points awarded for the various methods listed for BrobInt.java.
There are a total of 9 points awarded for the Collatz.java file including the
seven test cases.  The BrobIntTester.java file is not required to be in the repo
but will be added if it is not there.  If you have made any modifications to the
BrobIntTester.java file which are not reflected in the version that is on *MY*
repo, PLEASE put a copy of *YOUR* version into *YOUR* repo for use in evaluation.

The BrobIntTester.java file will be used to verify correct operation of your
BrobInt methods.  The points awarded are as shown below for each of the BrobInt
operations.  Parial credit is awarded if some of the tests pass and others do
not; i.e., if four tests get correct answers for subtraction and three don't,
you will get 4 points for the subtraction tests.

Point distribution is spread to help insure that if you don't get the more
difficult methods to work, your score will not be impacted as heavily.  For
example, add and multiply should be straightforward to implement, so they have
ten tests each for a total of 20 points.  Division is the hardest, so it has
only four tests.  Remaindering is easy, but requires division to work, so it
has only two tests.

There are two "gimme" items, one for "equals" tests for which there are three
points, and one for the Collatz constructor which is worth one point.

For this exercise you are required to have JavaDoc commments in your code.  The
javadoc tool will be run on your code as explained in class, using a very basic
automated method.  Mismatches or javadoc errors will be counted against the
total maximum of two points, in 1/2 point increments.  For example, if your
code takes an argument that is not listed in the javadocs using a "@param" tag,
that will cost 1/2 point.  Four such errors mean you will lose the entire
javadoc credit for the project.
